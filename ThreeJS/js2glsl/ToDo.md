#  Geometry
 * Simple rotational
    * Cylinder
    * Cone
    * Sphere
    * Torus
 * Quadric
    * hyperboloid1 r=sqrt(x*x-1)
    * hyperboloid2 r=sqrt(x*x+1)
    * paraboloid r=sqrt(x)
 * Composed bodies
    * Conical Capsula (cone with spherical caps)
    * piecewise body of revolution composed of Conic-Toroidal segments
    * piecewise body of revoluduon composed of Qudric segments (cone,sphere,hyperbola,parabola) 
  * Convex body of revolution
    * r=(x-1)*(x+1)
    * teardrop r=sqrt(x)*(x-1)
 * Beveled box
